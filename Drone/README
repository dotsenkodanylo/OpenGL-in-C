Drone Assignment

Hi there! I completed this assignment on my OS X system, which natively has GLUT pre-installed. To compile the C files, I used the following command:

	clang -o run -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL *.c,

which compiles all the files into an executable, which can be run with:

	./run

I will gladly come in and demo in person if need be; I hope you experience 0 
problems with compilation and testing of the program. Thank you!
